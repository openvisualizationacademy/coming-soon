Hi and welcome to the Open Visualization Academy.
My name is Alberto Cairo. I am the Knight Chair in

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080
infographics and data visualization at the School
of Communication of the University of Miami,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.720
where I also work for the Frost Institute
for Data Science and Computing. The Open

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.920
Visualization Academy is probably my most
ambitious project to this date. What I'm

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.760
planning to do is to create a platform in which
we gather knowledge about information design,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.960
infographics, data visualization, and
data communication. The launch date

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.800
for the open visualization academy is
December the 10th of 2025. Until then,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.920
we are going to be working on a series of video
courses for all of you. The first one is going

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.120
to be an introduction to information graphics
and data visualization that I will do myself.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.680
I will teach you the basics. I will teach
you how to start from the very bottom and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.560
then bring up your skills to the next level.
How to create engaging and beautiful and clear

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.480
uh data visualizations, maps, graphs, charts and
diagrams that you can use with your clients or

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.000
that you can use in your workplace. Then after
that after my course we are going to be also be

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.800
launching a series of courses that will go deeply
into different aspects of data visualization.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.960
The second component of the open visualization
academy is a series of indepth courses that touch

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.160
upon different aspects, different elements of
the craft or different components of the craft

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.320
of data visualization. Besides these conceptual
courses, we'll also have software tutorials.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.480
So for instance, we're going to have an
introduction to the R programming language,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.200
an introduction to Python, to rographs, to data
wrapper, to Adobe Illustrator. These are all

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.440
tools that are very dominant in the world of data
visualization. And then the third component of the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.200
open visualization academy, this is going to be
a massive open online course that I'm planning to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.600
offer every year beginning this December. All the
materials, all these courses and tutorials that

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.880
we are going to release on December the 10th
of 2025 are going to be free and open source.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm very excited about this project and I hope
that you are excited too. We will see you soon.
