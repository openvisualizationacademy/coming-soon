00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello and welcome to the Open Visualization&nbsp;
Academy. My name is Alberto Cairo and I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.280
the Knight Chair in Infographics and Data&nbsp;
Visualization at the University of Miami.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.680
Throughout my career, in the past three decades,&nbsp;
I have designed hundreds of infographics. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.200
taught thousands of students from all over the&nbsp;
world. And I have written four books about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.920
craft and the art of information design&nbsp;
and data visualization. And, even though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.760
I think that the Open Visualization Academy is&nbsp;
probably my most ambitious project to date. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.640
Open Visualization Academy will launch on&nbsp;
January 31st, 2026. And I'm here to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.560
you an overview of its contents and also of&nbsp;
its contributors. For more than a decade now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.760
I've been thinking that it would be great to&nbsp;
have an online platform where anybody can go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
and learn about information design&nbsp;
and data visualization for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.680
And that's exactly what the Open Visualization&nbsp;
Academy is. For the Open Visualization Academy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.360
I have collaborated with some of the top experts&nbsp;
in information design and data visualization. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.120
not going to name them all. You can just simply&nbsp;
take a look at our website and see who they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.720
are. You're probably going to see many familiar&nbsp;
faces in there. But how is the Academy going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.280
be structured? Well, the Academy is going to have&nbsp;
three different components. The first one is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.000
to be an introduction to information design and&nbsp;
data visualization class, that I will teach. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.800
is going to be around five or six hours of video&nbsp;
in which I will cover the elementary principles of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.720
information design and data visualization. After&nbsp;
my introductory class, the second component of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.200
Open Visualization Academy is going to be a series&nbsp;
of specialized courses created by the experts whom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.640
I just mentioned. Do you want to learn about&nbsp;
accessibility for data visualization? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.760
there's going to be a course about that. Do you&nbsp;
want to learn about business dashboards and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.440
to better communicate business data? We have you&nbsp;
covered. Or maybe you're interested in getting a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.280
little bit deeper into coding and programming&nbsp;
using R or Python. We also have content about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.960
that. Once again, I'm not going to list every&nbsp;
single master class and software tutorial that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.000
is part of the Open Visualization Academy.&nbsp;
You can just simply consult our website. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.040
that I can tell you is that I am pretty certain&nbsp;
that they will help you take your visualization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.960
design skills to the next level. Besides the&nbsp;
video master classes and software tutorials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.320
there is going to be a third component to the&nbsp;
open visualization academy, a Massive Open Online&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.840
Course (or MOOC) that I will teach myself every&nbsp;
year. We are still working out the details of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.600
MOOC. So if you want to stay up to date with it, I&nbsp;
would encourage you to sign up for our newsletter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.640
You can easily do it through our website. As I&nbsp;
said at the beginning, the Open Visualization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
Academy is my most ambitious project to date.&nbsp;
And I hope that by now you are as excited as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.840
am about it. If you are, I hope that you will join&nbsp;
me in this adventure. See you again in January.
